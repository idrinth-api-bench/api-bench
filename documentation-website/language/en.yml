    description: "Welcome to the documentation for the framework @idrinth/api-bench"
  title: "What does this project do?"
  what: "This project provides a framework for testing rest-apis and websites for  changes in response times."
  why: "This helps to detect performance changes in code in a quick and simple manner."
  benchmark:
    title: "Why use a Benchmark Runner?"
    microservices: "Given that the amount of APIs increase by moving to microservices, we need a way to determine if changes to a service's response times are related to code changes."
    purpose: "For this purpose a defined load with repeatable request seems the most useful."
  libraries:
    title: "Regarding existing libraries"
    description: "Other tools like matteofigus/api-benchmark, bvanderlaan/api-bench-runner, or jeffbski/bench-rest are all untouched for quite a while and don't provide type definitions for typescript. This makes them less desirable when working with projects where the better static code check is a huge boost in development speed."
    threading: "Additionally, this tool separates the validation thread from the thread processing the actual requests to further minimize the effect of complicated validations or huge response bodies on the data gathering."
