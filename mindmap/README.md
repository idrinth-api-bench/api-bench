# @idrinth/api-bench/mindmap

This mindmap is hosted [here](https://mindmap.idrinth-api-ben.ch).

To add to or edit the mindmap, have a look at the data.yml file. It is made up
of nodes - the single elements - that all start from the root node.

Node can contain four elements: text, description, URL and children. Text is
required to  actually be able to display the node, while children and URL are
optional. If children is set, these child nodes will be connected to their
parent, if URL is  set, the  node will contain a link to that URL.

Use children to break apart  a point and use the URL if there is a source of
information for that specific topic, or it otherwise makes sense.

Use the description field to add additional information that is shown when
hovering over the node.
